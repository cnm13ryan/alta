## ClassDef LookupParams
## Function Overview

The `LookupParams` class is designed to encapsulate parameters required for the last two Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers. These parameters include weights and biases necessary for performing computations within these layers.

## Parameters

- **weights_1**: A NumPy array representing the weights matrix for the first FFN layer.
- **bias_1**: A NumPy array representing the bias vector for the first FFN layer.
- **weights_2**: A NumPy array representing the weights matrix for the second FFN layer.
- **bias_2**: A NumPy array representing the bias vector for the second FFN layer.

## Return Values

The `LookupParams` class does not return any values; it is used to store and manage parameters for FFN layers.

## Detailed Explanation

The `LookupParams` class serves as a container for the weights and biases of the last two FFN layers. These parameters are essential for executing computations within these layers, which typically involve linear transformations followed by non-linear activations.

### Logic and Flow

1. **Initialization**: The class is initialized with four parameters: `weights_1`, `bias_1`, `weights_2`, and `bias_2`. Each parameter is expected to be a NumPy array.
   
2. **Usage**: Once instantiated, the `LookupParams` object holds these parameters, making them accessible for further computations within the FFN layers.

### Relationship Description

- **Referencer Content (Callers)**: The `build_lookup_params` function in `ffn_lookup_utils.py` is a caller of the `LookupParams` class. This function constructs and returns an instance of `LookupParams` by processing program specifications and dimension mappings.
  
  - **Function Purpose**: The `build_lookup_params` function builds the parameters for the last two FFN layers based on rules defined in a program specification (`program_spec`). It processes antecedent vectors, consequent vectors, and calculates biases to initialize the `LookupParams` object.

- **Reference Letter (Callees)**: There are no callees identified within the provided code. The `LookupParams` class is used directly by the `build_lookup_params` function without calling any other functions or methods internally.

## Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

### Limitations and Edge Cases

1. **Data Type Consistency**: Ensure that all input arrays (`weights_1`, `bias_1`, `weights_2`, `bias_2`) are of compatible shapes and data types to prevent runtime errors during computations.
   
2. **Initialization Order**: The order in which parameters are passed to the `LookupParams` constructor is crucial for correct operation. Misordering can lead to incorrect computations.

### Refactoring Opportunities

1. **Encapsulate Collection**: Consider encapsulating the weights and biases within a dictionary or another collection type if there is a need to manage multiple sets of parameters more dynamically.
   
2. **Introduce Explaining Variable**: If the construction logic for `weights_1`, `bias_1`, `weights_2`, and `bias_2` becomes complex, introduce explaining variables to break down the expressions into smaller, more manageable parts.

3. **Extract Method**: The logic within the `build_lookup_params` function could be refactored by extracting methods for specific tasks such as vector construction and bias calculation. This would improve readability and maintainability.

4. **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: If there are multiple conditional checks within the `build_lookup_params` function, consider using guard clauses to simplify the flow and reduce nesting.

By following these suggestions, the code can be made more robust, readable, and easier to maintain.

**Explanation**:
This JSON schema defines an object that represents a user profile. The object contains three properties: `name`, `age`, and `email`. Each property has a specific type and description:

- **name**: A string representing the name of the user.
- **age**: An integer representing the age of the user in years.
- **email**: A string formatted as an email address, representing the user's contact information.

The schema specifies that all three properties are required. The `additionalProperties` field is set to false, meaning that no other properties can be added to this object beyond those explicitly defined.
