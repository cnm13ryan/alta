## FunctionDef l2_loss(params, activation_fn, inputs, targets)
# Function Overview

The `l2_loss` function calculates and returns the L2 loss between predictions made by a model and the actual targets.

# Parameters

- **params**: A list of tuples containing `jnp.ndarray` elements. Each tuple represents a parameter set used in the neural network.
  - **referencer_content**: True
  - **reference_letter**: False
- **activation_fn**: A callable function that takes a `jnp.ndarray` as input and returns another `jnp.ndarray`. This function is applied during the prediction process within the neural network.
  - **referencer_content**: True
  - **reference_letter**: False
- **inputs**: A `jnp.ndarray` representing the input data to the neural network.
  - **referencer_content**: True
  - **reference_letter**: False
- **targets**: A `jnp.ndarray` representing the target values or labels for the input data.
  - **referencer_content**: True
  - **reference_letter**: False

# Return Values

The function returns a single value, `squared_error`, which is a float representing the L2 loss between the predictions and targets.

# Detailed Explanation

The `l2_loss` function computes the L2 loss by performing the following steps:
1. It uses the `inference.batched_predict` method to generate predictions based on the provided parameters (`params`), input data (`inputs`), and activation function (`activation_fn`).
2. It calculates the squared error between these predictions and the actual targets.
3. The mean of these squared errors is computed using `jnp.mean`, resulting in the final L2 loss value.

# Relationship Description

The `l2_loss` function is called by the `update` function located at `framework/traces/ffn/train.py/update`. This indicates a caller-callee relationship where `update` invokes `l2_loss` to compute the loss necessary for performing optimization steps in training a neural network.

# Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: The expression `jnp.mean(jnp.square(predictions - targets))` could be broken down into an intermediate variable, such as `squared_error`, to improve readability.
  
  ```python
  squared_errors = jnp.square(predictions - targets)
  mean_squared_error = jnp.mean(squared_errors)
  return mean_squared_error
  ```

- **Encapsulate Collection**: If the function is part of a larger class or module, consider encapsulating the `params` list within a class to manage parameter access and updates more effectively.

- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: Although this function does not contain conditionals, if additional logic (e.g., handling edge cases) is added in the future, ensure that conditional expressions are simplified using guard clauses for better readability.

By applying these refactoring suggestions, the code can become more maintainable and easier to understand.
