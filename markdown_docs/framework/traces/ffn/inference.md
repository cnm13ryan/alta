## FunctionDef predict(params, activations, activation_function)
## Function Overview

The `predict` function is designed to make predictions using a feedforward neural network (FFN) model. It processes input activations through layers defined by parameters and applies an activation function at each step.

## Parameters

- **params**: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: `w` (weights) and `b` (bias). These represent the parameters for each layer in the neural network.
  - Type: `list[tuple[jnp.ndarray, jnp.ndarray]]`
- **activations**: The input activations to be processed by the neural network.
  - Type: `jnp.ndarray`
- **activation_function**: A callable function that applies an activation function to the outputs of each layer.
  - Type: `Callable[[jnp.ndarray], jnp.ndarray]`

## Return Values

- Returns `logits`, which are the raw predictions from the final layer of the neural network.
  - Type: `jnp.ndarray`

## Detailed Explanation

The `predict` function processes input activations through a series of layers defined by the parameters. Here is the step-by-step logic:

1. **Initialization**: The function iterates over all but the last set of parameters (`params[:-1]`).

2. **Layer Processing**:
   - For each layer, it computes the weighted sum of inputs and adds the bias: `outputs = jnp.dot(w, activations) + b`.
   - It then applies the activation function to these outputs: `activations = activation_function(outputs)`.

3. **Final Layer**:
   - After processing all but the last layer, it retrieves the parameters for the final layer (`final_w, final_b`).
   - It computes the logits for the final layer using the same weighted sum and bias addition as before: `logits = jnp.dot(final_w, activations) + final_b`.

4. **Return**: The function returns the computed logits.

## Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Extract Method**: The loop that processes each layer could be extracted into a separate method for better readability and reusability.
  
  ```python
  def process_layer(w, b, activations, activation_function):
      outputs = jnp.dot(w, activations) + b
      return activation_function(outputs)
  ```

- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: The expression `jnp.dot(final_w, activations) + final_b` could be assigned to a variable named `final_logits` for clarity.

- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: If the number of layers is known or can be limited, consider using guard clauses to handle edge cases more gracefully.

By applying these refactoring techniques, the code can become more modular and easier to maintain.
