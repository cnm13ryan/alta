## FunctionDef parse_example(row)
### Function Overview

The `parse_example` function is designed to parse a single example from a SCAN data file. It processes each row by splitting it into input and output components, trimming prefixes, and replacing tokens with shorter versions.

### Parameters

- **row (str)**: The string representation of a single example row from the SCAN data file.

### Return Values

The function returns a tuple containing two strings:
- **input_string**: The processed input component of the example.
- **output_string**: The processed output component of the example, with tokens replaced by their shorter versions.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Splitting the Row**: The function begins by splitting the input `row` at the delimiter `"OUT:"`. This operation divides the row into two parts: the input and the output.
   
2. **Trimming Prefixes and Whitespace**:
   - For the input component, it removes the prefix `"IN:"` using the `removeprefix()` method and then strips any leading or trailing whitespace.
   - The output component is stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.

3. **Token Replacement**: The function iterates over a predefined dictionary `TARGET_MAP`, which maps longer tokens to their shorter versions. It replaces each occurrence of these tokens in the output string using the `replace()` method.

4. **Returning Processed Strings**: Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the processed input and output strings.

### Relationship Description

- **referencer_content**: The `parse_example` function is called by another function within the same module: `load_examples`. This indicates that `load_examples` acts as a caller to `parse_example`.
  
- **reference_letter**: There are no references to this component from other parts of the project, indicating that `parse_example` does not act as a callee.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

1. **Token Replacement Logic**:
   - The token replacement logic can be refactored using the **Extract Method** pattern if it becomes more complex or needs to be reused in different contexts.
   
2. **Error Handling**:
   - Currently, there is no error handling for cases where the input string does not contain the expected `"IN:"` prefix or `"OUT:"` delimiter. Adding checks and raising appropriate exceptions can improve robustness.

3. **Code Readability**:
   - The use of `removeprefix()` is a Python 3.9 feature. If compatibility with earlier versions is required, consider using slicing (`splits[0][3:]`) to remove the prefix.
   
4. **Modularity**:
   - If additional processing steps are needed for input or output strings in the future, encapsulating these operations within separate methods can enhance modularity and maintainability.

By following these refactoring suggestions, the code can be made more robust, readable, and easier to extend in the future.
