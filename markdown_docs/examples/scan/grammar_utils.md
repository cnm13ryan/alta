## ClassDef QCFGRule
# QCFGRule

## Function Overview
**QCFGRule** is a class representing a Quasi-synchronous Context-Free Grammar (QCFG) rule. It encapsulates the source and target symbols of the rule, along with their mapping.

## Parameters
- **referencer_content**: True
  - This parameter indicates that there are references to `QCFGRule` from other components within the project.
  
- **reference_letter**: True
  - This parameter shows that there is a reference to this component from other project parts, representing callees in the relationship.

## Return Values
- None

## Detailed Explanation
The `QCFGRule` class is designed to represent a rule in a Quasi-synchronous Context-Free Grammar (QCFG). It includes the following attributes:
- **source**: A list of symbols that form the source part of the rule.
- **target**: A list of symbols that form the target part of the rule.
- **mapping**: A list that maps non-terminals from the target to positions in the source.

The class provides a method `key` which returns a string representation of the rule, combining the source and target lists. This key is used for identifying unique rules within a grammar.

## Relationship Description
**QCFGRule** is referenced by several components within the project:
- **_maybe_add_rule**: Calls `QCFGRule.key()` to check if a rule already exists.
- **_set_matched_rule_vars**: Uses `QCFGRule` objects to set variables related to matched rules.
- **_get_child_nonterminal_idx**: Utilizes `QCFGRule.mapping` to determine the index of child non-terminals.

**QCFGRule** also references other components:
- **_maybe_add_rule**: Calls `QCFGRule.key()` which is used to add or retrieve a rule from a dictionary.
- **_set_matched_rule_vars**: Uses `QCFGRule` objects to set variables related to matched rules.
- **_get_child_nonterminal_idx**: Utilizes `QCFGRule.mapping` to determine the index of child non-terminals.

## Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions
### Limitations
- The class currently does not include any validation for the input symbols or mapping, which could lead to errors if invalid data is provided.
  
### Edge Cases
- If the source or target lists are empty, the `key` method will return an empty string. This might not be desirable in all contexts.

### Refactoring Opportunities
1. **Encapsulate Collection**: The class exposes its internal collections (`source`, `target`, and `mapping`). Encapsulating these collections by providing getter methods can improve data integrity.
   
   ```python
   class QCFGRule:
       def __init__(self, source, target, mapping):
           self._source = source
           self._target = target
           self._mapping = mapping

       @property
       def source(self):
           return self._source

       @property
       def target(self):
           return self._target

       @property
       def mapping(self):
           return self._mapping
   ```

2. **Introduce Explaining Variable**: The `key` method concatenates the source and target lists into a single string. Introducing an explaining variable can improve readability.

   ```python
   class QCFGRule:
       def key(self):
           source_str = ''.join(str(symbol) for symbol in self.source)
           target_str = ''.join(str(symbol) for symbol in self.target)
           return f"{source_str}_{target_str}"
   ```

3. **Replace Conditional with Polymorphism**: If there are different types of rules that require different behaviors, consider using polymorphism to handle them.

4. **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: The `_get_child_nonterminal_idx` method has a loop that counts non-terminals. Using guard clauses can simplify the logic.

   ```python
   def _get_child_nonterminal_idx(rule, symbol_index):
       if symbol_index < 0 or symbol_index >= len(rule.target):
           raise ValueError("Invalid symbol index")
       
       nonterminal_count = 0
       for idx in range(symbol_index):
           if rule.target[idx] in grammar_utils.NONTERMINALS:
               nonterminal_count += 1
       
       return rule.mapping[nonterminal_count]
   ```

By implementing these refactoring suggestions, the `QCFGRule` class can become more robust, readable, and maintainable.
### FunctionDef key(self)
**Function Overview**: The `key` function is designed to return a string representation of the source associated with an instance of the `QCFGRule` class by joining its elements with spaces.

**Parameters**:
- **referencer_content**: This parameter indicates if there are references (callers) from other components within the project to this component. In this case, it is not provided.
- **reference_letter**: This parameter shows if there is a reference to this component from other project parts, representing callees in the relationship. It is also not provided.

**Return Values**:
- The function returns a single string that is the result of joining all elements of the `source` attribute of the `QCFGRule` instance with spaces.

**Detailed Explanation**:
The `key` function operates by utilizing Python's built-in `str.join()` method. This method takes an iterable (in this case, `self.source`) and concatenates its elements into a single string, inserting a space between each element. The logic is straightforward: it assumes that `self.source` is a list or tuple of strings.

**Relationship Description**:
Since neither `referencer_content` nor `reference_letter` are provided, there is no functional relationship to describe in terms of callers or callees within the project.

**Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions**:
- **Edge Cases**: The function assumes that `self.source` contains only string elements. If `self.source` contains non-string elements, a `TypeError` will be raised. To handle this, consider adding type checking or conversion logic.
- **Refactoring Opportunities**:
  - **Introduce Explaining Variable**: Although the current implementation is concise, introducing an explaining variable for clarity might be beneficial if `self.source` becomes more complex in future iterations.
    ```python
    source_elements = self.source
    return " ".join(source_elements)
    ```
  - **Encapsulate Collection**: If direct access to `self.source` is exposed and used elsewhere, encapsulating it within a method or property could improve encapsulation and maintainability.

This documentation provides a clear understanding of the `key` function's purpose, logic, and potential areas for improvement.

## ClassDef Vocab
### Function Overview

The `Vocab` class defines a mapping between tokens and integers, facilitating the encoding and decoding of tokens into their corresponding integer indices.

### Parameters

- **referencer_content**: This parameter indicates that there are references (callers) from other components within the project to this component. Specifically, the `get_symbol_vocab` function in `examples/scan/grammar_utils.py` and the `_get_input_vocab` function in `examples/scan/scan_utils.py` both instantiate the `Vocab` class.
- **reference_letter**: This parameter shows that there is a reference to this component from other project parts, representing callees in the relationship. The `encode_tokens` and `decode_tokens` methods of the `Vocab` class are called by these references.

### Return Values

- None

### Detailed Explanation

The `Vocab` class is designed to manage a vocabulary of tokens, providing a bidirectional mapping between tokens and their corresponding integer indices. This mapping is useful in natural language processing tasks where tokens need to be converted into numerical representations for model training or inference.

#### Initialization (`__init__` method)

- The constructor takes a list of `tokens` as input.
- It initializes two dictionaries:
  - `token_to_idx`: Maps each token to its corresponding integer index.
  - `idx_to_token`: Maps each integer index back to its corresponding token.
- These mappings are created by iterating over the `tokens` list and assigning an index to each token.

#### Encoding Tokens (`encode_tokens` method)

- This method takes a list of tokens as input.
- It returns a list of integers, where each integer corresponds to the index of the respective token in the vocabulary.

#### Decoding Tokens (`decode_tokens` method)

- This method takes a list of integer indices as input.
- It returns a list of tokens, where each token corresponds to the integer index in the vocabulary.

### Relationship Description

The `Vocab` class is referenced by two functions within the project:
1. **Callers**:
   - `get_symbol_vocab`: This function creates an instance of `Vocab` using a tuple of symbols that includes padding and various terminal and non-terminal symbols.
   - `_get_input_vocab`: This function creates an instance of `Vocab` using a combination of source terminals and special input tokens.

2. **Callees**:
   - The `encode_tokens` and `decode_tokens` methods of the `Vocab` class are called by these references to convert between tokens and their integer indices.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Edge Cases**: Ensure that all tokens passed to the constructor are unique, as duplicate tokens will overwrite each other in the mappings.
- **Refactoring Opportunities**:
  - **Encapsulate Collection**: The internal dictionaries `token_to_idx` and `idx_to_token` could be encapsulated within private methods or properties to prevent direct access from outside the class. This would enhance encapsulation and maintainability.
  - **Introduce Explaining Variable**: If the logic for initializing the mappings becomes more complex, consider introducing explaining variables to break down the process into smaller, more understandable steps.

By following these guidelines, the `Vocab` class can be made more robust and easier to maintain.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, tokens)
## Function Overview

The `__init__` function initializes a new instance of the `Vocab` class by mapping tokens to their corresponding indices and vice versa.

## Parameters

- **tokens**: A list of unique tokens (strings) that will be used to build the vocabulary. Each token is assigned a unique index starting from 0.

## Return Values

This function does not return any values; it initializes instance variables `token_to_idx` and `idx_to_token`.

## Detailed Explanation

The `__init__` function takes a list of tokens as input and creates two dictionaries:
- `token_to_idx`: Maps each token to its corresponding index.
- `idx_to_token`: Maps each index back to its corresponding token.

This is achieved through a simple loop that iterates over the list of tokens, using the `enumerate` function to get both the index and the token. Each token is added to `token_to_idx` with its index as the value, and each index is added to `idx_to_token` with the token as the value.

## Relationship Description

There are no references provided for this component, so there is no functional relationship to describe in terms of callers or callees within the project.

## Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Edge Cases**: The function assumes that all tokens in the input list are unique. If duplicates exist, only the last occurrence will be stored in the dictionaries.
- **Refactoring Opportunities**:
  - **Encapsulate Collection**: Currently, the internal collections `token_to_idx` and `idx_to_token` are directly exposed as instance variables. Encapsulating these collections by providing getter methods can improve encapsulation and prevent external modification.
  - **Introduce Explaining Variable**: If this function is part of a larger class with more complex logic, introducing explaining variables for the dictionary keys (`token_key` and `idx_key`) could enhance readability.

By addressing these points, the code can become more robust and maintainable.

### FunctionDef encode_tokens(self, tokens)
---

**Function Overview**

The `encode_tokens` function is designed to convert a list of tokens into their corresponding indices based on a predefined mapping stored within the `token_to_idx` dictionary.

**Parameters**

- **tokens**: A list of strings representing the tokens to be encoded. Each token must exist in the `token_to_idx` dictionary; otherwise, this will result in a KeyError.

**Return Values**

The function returns a list of integers where each integer is the index corresponding to a token from the input list.

**Detailed Explanation**

The `encode_tokens` function operates by iterating over each token in the provided list. For each token, it retrieves its corresponding index from the `token_to_idx` dictionary and collects these indices into a new list. The final list of indices is then returned as the output.

- **Logic Flow**: 
  1. Initialize an empty list to store encoded token indices.
  2. Iterate over each token in the input list.
  3. For each token, fetch its index from `token_to_idx`.
  4. Append the fetched index to the result list.
  5. Return the result list containing all encoded indices.

**Relationship Description**

- **referencer_content**: This parameter is not provided, indicating that there are no references (callers) from other components within the project to this component.
- **reference_letter**: This parameter is also not provided, suggesting that there is no reference to this component from other project parts.

Since neither `referencer_content` nor `reference_letter` is truthy, there is no functional relationship to describe regarding callers or callees within the project.

**Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions**

- **Limitations**: The function assumes that all tokens in the input list exist in the `token_to_idx` dictionary. If a token is not found, a KeyError will be raised.
- **Edge Cases**: Consider handling cases where some tokens might not have an index by providing a default value or skipping those tokens.
- **Refactoring Opportunities**:
  - **Introduce Explaining Variable**: The list comprehension could be broken down into a more readable loop with intermediate variables if the logic becomes complex in future extensions.
  - **Encapsulate Collection**: If `token_to_idx` is accessed frequently, consider encapsulating it within a class method or property to manage access and potential changes.

This documentation provides a clear understanding of the `encode_tokens` function's purpose, parameters, return values, detailed logic, and suggests areas for improvement in terms of robustness and readability.
***
### FunctionDef decode_tokens(self, token_ids)
---

**Function Overview**

The `decode_tokens` function is designed to convert a list of token IDs into their corresponding string tokens using a mapping provided by the `idx_to_token` dictionary.

**Parameters**

- **token_ids**: A list of integers representing token IDs that need to be decoded into their respective string tokens. Each integer in the list corresponds to an index in the `idx_to_token` dictionary.

**Return Values**

- Returns a list of strings, where each string is the token corresponding to the ID provided in the input list.

**Detailed Explanation**

The function iterates over the `token_ids` list and uses list comprehension to map each token ID to its corresponding token string using the `idx_to_token` dictionary. The logic is straightforward: for each index (`idx`) in the `token_ids` list, it fetches the associated token from the `idx_to_token` dictionary and collects these tokens into a new list.

**Relationship Description**

There are no references provided to indicate relationships with other components within the project. Therefore, there is no functional relationship to describe regarding callers or callees.

**Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions**

- **Edge Cases**: If any token ID in `token_ids` does not exist in the `idx_to_token` dictionary, a `KeyError` will be raised. Consider adding error handling to manage such cases gracefully.
  
  ```python
  def decode_tokens(self, token_ids):
      return [self.idx_to_token.get(idx, f"<UNK>") for idx in token_ids]
  ```
  
- **Refactoring Suggestions**:
  - **Introduce Explaining Variable**: If the function is part of a larger class with complex logic, consider introducing an explaining variable to store intermediate results or improve readability.
  
  ```python
  def decode_tokens(self, token_ids):
      decoded_tokens = [self.idx_to_token[idx] for idx in token_ids]
      return decoded_tokens
  ```
  
- **Encapsulate Collection**: If the `idx_to_token` dictionary is exposed and used directly by other parts of the code, consider encapsulating it within a method to control access and modification.
  
  ```python
  def get_token(self, idx):
      return self.idx_to_token.get(idx, f"<UNK>")
  
  def decode_tokens(self, token_ids):
      return [self.get_token(idx) for idx in token_ids]
  ```

This documentation provides a clear understanding of the `decode_tokens` function's purpose, parameters, return values, logic, and potential refactoring opportunities to enhance its robustness and maintainability.
***
## FunctionDef get_symbol_vocab
### Function Overview

The `get_symbol_vocab` function constructs and returns a vocabulary object (`Vocab`) that maps various symbols (including padding and terminal/non-terminal tokens) to integer indices.

### Parameters

- **referencer_content**: This parameter indicates that there are references (callers) from other components within the project to this component. Specifically, the `get_symbol_id` function in `examples/scan/grammar_utils.py` calls `get_symbol_vocab` to retrieve a vocabulary instance for encoding symbol tokens.
- **reference_letter**: This parameter shows that there is a reference to this component from other project parts, representing callees in the relationship. The `encode_tokens` and `decode_tokens` methods of the `Vocab` class are called by these references to convert between tokens and their integer indices.

### Return Values

- **Vocab**: An instance of the `Vocab` class initialized with a tuple of symbols that includes padding and various terminal and non-terminal symbols.

### Detailed Explanation

The `get_symbol_vocab` function is responsible for creating a vocabulary object (`Vocab`) that encapsulates the mapping between tokens (symbols) and their corresponding integer indices. This mapping is essential for encoding and decoding tokens in natural language processing tasks, particularly within the context of parsing grammars.

#### Logic and Flow

1. **Symbol Collection**: The function begins by collecting all symbols into a tuple named `symbols`. This tuple includes:
   - A padding symbol `"PAD"`.
   - Symbols from `SOURCE_TERMINALS` (not explicitly defined in the provided code).
   - Symbols from `TARGET_TERMINALS` (not explicitly defined in the provided code).
   - Symbols from `NONTERMINALS` (not explicitly defined in the provided code).

2. **Vocabulary Creation**: The function then creates an instance of the `Vocab` class, passing the `symbols` tuple to its constructor.

3. **Return**: Finally, the function returns the created `Vocab` instance.

### Relationship Description

- **Callers (referencer_content)**: The `get_symbol_id` function in `examples/scan/grammar_utils.py` calls `get_symbol_vocab` to obtain a vocabulary instance for encoding symbol tokens into their corresponding integer indices.
  
- **Callees (reference_letter)**: The `encode_tokens` and `decode_tokens` methods of the `Vocab` class are called by other parts of the project to convert between tokens and their integer indices.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Edge Cases**: Ensure that all symbol collections (`SOURCE_TERMINALS`, `TARGET_TERMINALS`, `NONTERMINALS`) are properly defined and populated before calling `get_symbol_vocab`. Otherwise, the resulting vocabulary may be incomplete or incorrect.
  
- **Refactoring Opportunities**:
  - **Encapsulate Collection**: The function directly exposes the construction of the `symbols` tuple. Consider encapsulating this logic within a separate method to improve modularity and maintainability.
    ```python
    def _collect_symbols():
        return ("PAD",) + SOURCE_TERMINALS + TARGET_TERMINALS + NONTERMINALS

    def get_symbol_vocab():
        symbols = _collect_symbols()
        return Vocab(symbols)
    ```
  - **Introduce Explaining Variable**: If the `symbols` tuple becomes complex or lengthy, introduce an explaining variable to improve readability.
    ```python
    def get_symbol_vocab():
        padding_symbol = ("PAD",)
        all_symbols = padding_symbol + SOURCE_TERMINALS + TARGET_TERMINALS + NONTERMINALS
        return Vocab(all_symbols)
    ```

By following these refactoring suggestions, the code can become more modular, easier to understand, and less prone to errors.

## FunctionDef get_symbol_token(symbol_id)
### Function Overview

The `get_symbol_token` function retrieves and returns the token associated with a given symbol ID from the vocabulary. If the symbol ID is `None`, it returns `None`.

### Parameters

- **symbol_id**: An integer representing the ID of the symbol for which the corresponding token needs to be retrieved.
  - **referencer_content**: This parameter indicates that there are references (callers) from other components within the project to this component. Specifically, the `_get_stack_symbol` function in `examples/scan/scan_parser_program.py` and the `decode_output` method in `examples/scan/scan_utils.py` call `get_symbol_token`.
  - **reference_letter**: This parameter shows that there is a reference to this component from other project parts, representing callees in the relationship. The function itself does not have any callees.

### Return Values

- **str | None**: Returns the token associated with the given symbol ID as a string if found; otherwise, returns `None`.

### Detailed Explanation

The `get_symbol_token` function is responsible for mapping a symbol ID to its corresponding token using a vocabulary object. This mapping is essential for decoding symbol IDs back into their respective tokens in various parsing tasks.

#### Logic and Flow

1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the provided `symbol_id` is `None`. If it is, the function immediately returns `None`.

2. **Vocabulary Retrieval**: If the `symbol_id` is not `None`, the function retrieves the vocabulary object by calling `grammar_utils.get_symbol_token(symbol_id - 1)`.

3. **Token Lookup**: The function then looks up the token associated with the given symbol ID in the retrieved vocabulary object.

4. **Return Token**: Finally, the function returns the token if found; otherwise, it returns `None`.

### Relationship Description

- **Callers**:
  - `_get_stack_symbol` in `examples/scan/scan_parser_program.py`: This function calls `get_symbol_token` to retrieve the token for a given symbol ID.
  - `decode_output` in `examples/scan/scan_utils.py`: This method iterates over a list of output IDs and calls `get_symbol_token` for each ID to decode the output into tokens.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Edge Cases**: The function handles cases where the `symbol_id` is `None` by returning `None`. Ensure that this behavior aligns with the expected usage in the project.
- **Refactoring Opportunities**:
  - **Encapsulate Collection**: If the logic for retrieving tokens from the vocabulary object becomes more complex, consider encapsulating it into a separate method to improve modularity and maintainability.
  - **Introduce Explaining Variable**: If the expression `symbol_id - 1` becomes more complex or is used in multiple places, introduce an explaining variable to enhance readability.

By following these guidelines and suggestions, the function can be maintained effectively and integrated seamlessly into the broader project.
