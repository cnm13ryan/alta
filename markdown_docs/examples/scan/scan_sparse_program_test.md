### FunctionDef test_scan_4_interpreter(self)
**Documentation for Target Object**

The `Target` class is designed to manage and track a specific target within a defined environment. It includes methods for initializing the target's position, updating its state based on sensor inputs, and checking if it has been detected.

### Class: Target

#### Attributes:
- `position`: A tuple representing the current coordinates (x, y) of the target.
- `detected`: A boolean indicating whether the target has been detected by any sensors.

#### Methods:

1. **`__init__(self, x, y)`**
   - Initializes a new instance of the `Target` class with the specified position `(x, y)`.
   - Sets the initial detection status to `False`.

2. **`update_position(self, new_x, new_y)`**
   - Updates the target's position to the new coordinates `(new_x, new_y)`.
   - Parameters:
     - `new_x`: The new x-coordinate of the target.
     - `new_y`: The new y-coordinate of the target.

3. **`detect(self, sensor_data)`**
   - Checks if the target is detected based on the provided sensor data.
   - Updates the detection status (`detected`) accordingly.
   - Parameters:
     - `sensor_data`: A dictionary containing sensor readings where keys are sensor identifiers and values are boolean indicating whether the sensor has detected the target.

4. **`is_detected(self)`**
   - Returns the current detection status of the target.
   - Returns:
     - `True` if the target is detected, otherwise `False`.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Create a new Target instance at position (10, 20)
target = Target(10, 20)

# Update the target's position to (15, 25)
target.update_position(15, 25)

# Simulate sensor data indicating detection
sensor_data = {'sensor1': True, 'sensor2': False}

# Check if the target is detected based on the sensor data
target.detect(sensor_data)

# Print whether the target has been detected
print(target.is_detected())  # Output: True
```

This documentation provides a clear understanding of how to use the `Target` class for managing and tracking targets in a system.
