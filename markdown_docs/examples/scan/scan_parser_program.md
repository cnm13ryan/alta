## FunctionDef _get_stack_symbol(symbol_id)
### Function Overview

The `_get_stack_symbol` function retrieves and returns the token associated with a given symbol ID from the grammar. If the symbol ID is `0`, it returns `None`.

### Parameters

- **symbol_id**: An integer representing the ID of the symbol for which the corresponding token needs to be retrieved.
  - **referencer_content**: This parameter indicates that there are references (callers) from other components within the project to this component. Specifically, the `_maybe_match_rule` function in `examples/scan/scan_parser_program.py` calls `_get_stack_symbol`.
  - **reference_letter**: This parameter shows that there is a reference to this component from other project parts, representing callees in the relationship. The function itself does not have any callees.

### Return Values

- **str | None**: Returns the token associated with the given symbol ID as a string if found; otherwise, returns `None`.

### Detailed Explanation

The `_get_stack_symbol` function is responsible for mapping a symbol ID to its corresponding token using the `grammar_utils.get_symbol_token` function. This mapping is essential for decoding symbol IDs back into their respective tokens in various parsing tasks.

#### Logic and Flow

1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the provided `symbol_id` is `0`. If it is, the function immediately returns `None`.

2. **Token Retrieval**: If the `symbol_id` is not `0`, the function calls `grammar_utils.get_symbol_token(symbol_id - 1)` to retrieve the token associated with the given symbol ID.

3. **Return Token**: The retrieved token is returned as the output of the function.

### Relationship Description

- **Callers**: The `_get_stack_symbol` function is called by the `_maybe_match_rule` function in `examples/scan/scan_parser_program.py`. This indicates that the `_get_stack_symbol` function is used to fetch tokens for symbols during rule matching.
- **Callees**: The `_get_stack_symbol` function does not call any other functions within the provided code.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Edge Cases**: If the `symbol_id` is `0`, the function returns `None`. This behavior should be documented or handled appropriately in calling contexts.
- **Refactoring Opportunities**:
  - **Introduce Explaining Variable**: The expression `symbol_id - 1` could be assigned to an explaining variable for clarity, especially if this calculation is complex or used multiple times.
    ```python
    adjusted_symbol_id = symbol_id - 1
    return grammar_utils.get_symbol_token(adjusted_symbol_id)
    ```
  - **Encapsulate Collection**: If the function were part of a larger class, encapsulating the logic for retrieving tokens could improve modularity and maintainability.

This documentation provides a clear understanding of the `_get_stack_symbol` function's purpose, parameters, return values, logic, relationships within the project, and potential areas for improvement.

## FunctionDef _rule_id(rule)
# Function Overview

**_rule_id** is a function that returns the 1-based index of a given Quasi-synchronous Context-Free Grammar (QCFG) rule within a predefined list of rules.

# Parameters

- **matched_rule**: A `grammar_utils.QCFGRule` object representing the QCFG rule for which the index is to be determined.
  - **referencer_content**: This parameter indicates that there are references (callers) from other components within the project to this component. Specifically, it is called by the `reduce` function in `scan_parser_program.py`.
  - **reference_letter**: This parameter shows that there is a reference to this component from other project parts, representing callees in the relationship.

# Return Values

- Returns an integer representing the 1-based index of the provided QCFG rule within the predefined list of rules. If the rule is not found, the function will raise a `ValueError`.

# Detailed Explanation

The `_rule_id` function iterates over a predefined list of QCFG rules to find the index of the given `matched_rule`. The function uses the `key()` method of the `QCFGRule` class to compare the rules. Once the rule is found, the function returns its 1-based index within the list. If the rule is not found, a `ValueError` is raised.

The logic flow of the `_rule_id` function is as follows:
1. Iterate over each rule in the predefined list.
2. Compare the current rule with the `matched_rule` using the `key()` method.
3. If a match is found, return the 1-based index of the rule.
4. If no match is found after iterating through all rules, raise a `ValueError`.

# Relationship Description

- **Callers**: The `_rule_id` function is called by the `reduce` function in `scan_parser_program.py`. This indicates that the `reduce` function requires the 1-based index of a QCFG rule to perform its operations.
- **Callees**: There are no other components within the project that this function calls.

# Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

**Limitations**:
- The function assumes that the predefined list of rules is accessible and correctly populated. If the list is not properly maintained, it may lead to incorrect indexing or errors.
- The function raises a `ValueError` if the rule is not found in the list. This behavior should be handled appropriately by the caller to ensure robustness.

**Edge Cases**:
- If the predefined list of rules is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError`.
- If the `matched_rule` is not present in the list, the function will raise a `ValueError`.

**Refactoring Suggestions**:
1. **Encapsulate Collection**: Encapsulate the predefined list of rules within a class or module to improve modularity and maintainability.
2. **Introduce Explaining Variable**: Introduce an explaining variable for the 1-based index calculation to improve code readability.
3. **Replace Conditional with Polymorphism**: If the logic for finding the rule's index becomes more complex, consider replacing conditional statements with polymorphic behavior.
4. **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: Use guard clauses to simplify conditional expressions and improve code clarity.

By implementing these refactoring suggestions, the `_rule_id` function can become more robust, readable, and maintainable.
## FunctionDef _rule_len(rule)
# Function Overview

**_rule_len** is a function that calculates and returns the length of the source part of a Quasi-synchronous Context-Free Grammar (QCFG) rule.

## Parameters

- **rule**: A `grammar_utils.QCFGRule` object representing the QCFG rule.
  - This parameter indicates that there are references (callers) from other components within the project to this component (`referencer_content` is truthy).
  - This parameter shows if there is a reference to this component from other project parts, representing callees in the relationship (`reference_letter` is truthy).

## Return Values

- The function returns an integer representing the length of the source part of the QCFG rule.

## Detailed Explanation

The `_rule_len` function takes a `grammar_utils.QCFGRule` object as its parameter. It accesses the `source` attribute of this object, which is a tuple containing the nonterminal or terminal symbols for the source part of the rule. The function then calculates and returns the length of this tuple using Python's built-in `len()` function.

## Relationship Description

- **Callers**: The `_rule_len` function is called by the `reduce` function in the same module (`examples/scan/scan_parser_program.py`). This indicates that there are references from other components within the project to this component.
  
  ```python
  def reduce(z: simple_mlp.VarsWrapper, matched_rule: grammar_utils.QCFGRule):
    """Implements reduce action."""
    # Pop RHS elements and add LHS nonterminal to stack.
    if z["position"] == (z["stack_pointer_0"] - _rule_len(matched_rule)):
      z["symbol_id"] = _rule_lhs_id(matched_rule)
    _shift_stack_pointers(z, 1 - _rule_len(matched_rule))
    # Add rule to parse tree.
    if z["position"] == z["tree_pointer"]:
      # Use 1-indexing to reserve 0 for no rule.
      z["rule_id"] = _rule_id(matched_rule)
    z["tree_pointer"] += 1
  ```

- **Callees**: The `_rule_len` function does not call any other functions within the provided code. It is a standalone utility function that performs a specific task.

## Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

### Limitations

- The function assumes that the `source` attribute of the `grammar_utils.QCFGRule` object is always present and is a tuple. If these assumptions are not met, the function may raise an error or produce incorrect results.

### Edge Cases

- If the `source` attribute is an empty tuple, the function will return 0.
- If the `rule` parameter is `None`, the function will raise a `TypeError`.

### Refactoring Opportunities

- **Encapsulate Collection**: The function directly accesses the `source` attribute of the `grammar_utils.QCFGRule` object. To improve encapsulation and reduce dependencies on the internal structure of the `QCFGRule` class, consider adding a method to the `QCFGRule` class that returns the length of the source part.

  ```python
  class QCFGRule:
    """A Quasi-synchronous Context-Free Grammar (QCFG) rule."""

    # RHS list of nonterminal or terminal symbols for source and target.
    source: tuple[str, ...]
    target: tuple[str, ...]
    # LHS nonterminal symbol.
    lhs: str = "S"
    # For each target nonterminal, a mapping to corresponding source nonterminal.
    mapping: tuple[int, ...] = tuple()

    def key(self) -> str:
      return " ".join(self.source)

    def source_length(self) -> int:
      return len(self.source)
  ```

- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: If the `_rule_len` function is used frequently in complex expressions or conditions, consider introducing an explaining variable to improve readability.

  ```python
  def reduce(z: simple_mlp.VarsWrapper, matched_rule: grammar_utils.QCFGRule):
    """Implements reduce action."""
    rule_length = _rule_len(matched_rule)
    if z["position"] == (z["stack_pointer_0"] - rule_length):
      z["symbol_id"] = _rule_lhs_id(matched_rule)
    _shift_stack_pointers(z, 1 - rule_length)
    # Add rule to parse tree.
    if z["position"] == z["tree_pointer"]:
      # Use 1-indexing to reserve 0 for no rule.
      z["rule_id"] = _rule_id(matched_rule)
    z["tree_pointer"] += 1
  ```

By implementing these refactoring suggestions, the `_rule_len` function can become more robust and maintainable.

## FunctionDef _get_symbol_id(input_id)
### Function Overview

The `_get_symbol_id` function retrieves a symbol ID based on the provided input ID. It first converts the input ID into a token string using `scan_utils.get_input_token`, then fetches the corresponding symbol ID from `grammar_utils.get_symbol_id`. If no symbol ID is found, it returns 0; otherwise, it returns the symbol ID incremented by 1.

### Parameters

- **input_id**: An integer representing the ID of the input token. This parameter is required and must not be `None`.

  - **referencer_content**: This parameter indicates that there are references (callers) from other components within the project to this component.
    - **Callers**:
      - `examples/scan/scan_parser_program.py/shift`

- **reference_letter**: This parameter shows that there is a reference to this component from other project parts, representing callees in the relationship.
  - **Callees**:
    - `scan_utils.get_input_token(input_id)`
    - `grammar_utils.get_symbol_id(symbol_token)`

### Return Values

- Returns an integer representing the symbol ID. If no corresponding symbol ID is found, it returns 0.

### Detailed Explanation

The `_get_symbol_id` function performs the following steps:
1. It calls `scan_utils.get_input_token(input_id)` to convert the input ID into a token string.
2. It then calls `grammar_utils.get_symbol_id(symbol_token)` with the retrieved token string to get the symbol ID.
3. If the returned symbol ID is `None`, it means no corresponding symbol was found, and the function returns 0.
4. If a valid symbol ID is found, it increments this ID by 1 before returning it.

### Relationship Description

- **Callers**: The `_get_symbol_id` function is called by the `shift` function in `examples/scan/scan_parser_program.py`.
- **Callees**: The `_get_symbol_id` function calls two other functions:
  - `scan_utils.get_input_token(input_id)` to convert an input ID to a token string.
  - `grammar_utils.get_symbol_id(symbol_token)` to fetch the symbol ID based on the token.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

- **Edge Cases**: If the input ID provided is invalid or does not correspond to any token, the function will return 0. Ensure that valid input IDs are always passed to avoid unexpected behavior.
  
- **Refactoring Opportunities**:
  - **Introduce Explaining Variable**: The result of `scan_utils.get_input_token(input_id)` could be stored in an explaining variable to improve code readability and maintainability.
    ```python
    token = scan_utils.get_input_token(input_id)
    symbol_id = grammar_utils.get_symbol_id(token)
    return symbol_id + 1 if symbol_id is not None else 0
    ```
  
- **Encapsulate Collection**: If the logic for converting input IDs to tokens and fetching symbol IDs becomes more complex, consider encapsulating this functionality within a separate class or module to improve separation of concerns and modularity.

By following these suggestions, the code can be made more readable, maintainable, and easier to extend in the future.
## FunctionDef _shift_stack_pointers(z, stack_pointer_offset)
### Function Overview

The `_shift_stack_pointers` function is designed to update stack pointers within a `VarsWrapper` object by a specified offset. This adjustment ensures that stack pointers remain valid and within bounds.

### Parameters

1. **z** (`simple_mlp.VarsWrapper`)
   - **Description**: An instance of the `VarsWrapper` class, which encapsulates variables used in parsing operations.
   - **referencer_content**: True
   - **reference_letter**: True

2. **matched_rule** (`grammar_utils.QCFGRule`, optional)
   - **Description**: A rule from a grammar utility that specifies how stack pointers should be adjusted during parsing actions like reduce or shift.

### Return Values

- None: The function modifies the `VarsWrapper` object in place and does not return any values.

### Detailed Explanation

The `_shift_stack_pointers` function adjusts the stack pointers within the `VarsWrapper` object based on a given offset. This adjustment is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the parsing process, ensuring that stack pointers correctly reflect the current state of the parser's stack.

1. **Offset Calculation**: The function calculates the new value for `stack_pointer_0` by adding the specified offset to its current value.
2. **Boundary Check**: It ensures that the updated stack pointer does not go below zero, preventing potential out-of-bounds errors.
3. **Pointer Update**: The function updates all relevant stack pointers (`stack_pointer_0`, `tree_pointer`, etc.) based on the calculated new value.

### Relationship Description

- **Callers**: The `_shift_stack_pointers` function is called by two other functions within the project:
  - `reduce(z: simple_mlp.VarsWrapper, matched_rule: grammar_utils.QCFGRule)`: This function implements the reduce action in parsing and calls `_shift_stack_pointers` to adjust stack pointers after reducing a rule.
  - `shift(z: simple_mlp.VarsWrapper)`: This function implements the shift action in parsing and calls `_shift_stack_pointers` to adjust stack pointers after shifting a token.

- **Callees**: The `_shift_stack_pointers` function does not call any other functions within the project. It is purely a utility function responsible for adjusting stack pointers.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions

1. **Boundary Check**: Ensure that the boundary check for `stack_pointer_0` remains robust to prevent out-of-bounds errors.
2. **Refactoring Opportunities**:
   - **Extract Method**: If the logic for updating other stack pointers becomes more complex, consider extracting this into a separate method to improve readability and maintainability.
   - **Introduce Explaining Variable**: For complex expressions involving stack pointer calculations, introduce explaining variables to clarify the code's intent.

By adhering to these guidelines, the `_shift_stack_pointers` function can be effectively maintained and extended in future parsing operations.
